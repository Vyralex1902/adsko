      <h2 className="text-green-400 text-2xl">How it began</h2>
      <p id="texts">This all started one day when I <span className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">(Cyberspark, AKA the founder)</span> founded the company RockBear with
      a friend. I was the only one who knew how to code, so I was the mind and the developer and he was
      the 'commercialist'. After some time and releases, I decided to found one sub-company: ANTIVE, to which I assigned
      the task of developing the website and some 3rd party tools for the company. I took the entire ownership of RockBear
      and gave ANTIVE to my friend. Since we couldn't get the small team to work together the right way, we founded
      QuantumKillers, a new company that would wrap all the team together to work on a single app per time.
      Unfortunatly none of these company got far, so I decided to found this company
      which is now ADSKOâ„¢ S.C. and get rid of all the others.
